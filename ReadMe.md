# What Are The Fundamental Causes Of The Local Financial Difficulties in China? 

## Summary  
It can be said that the local financial difficulties in China are caused by many reasons. The overcapacity problems left by the rapid industrial development in the early years, the lack of long-term development projects of the government (long-term taxation raise from the development of enterprises and citizens), low utilization of infrastructure and urban facilities (Empty Cities), restrictions on the free flow of population, and the unwilling of enterprises to entry caused by the opacity of the system. In addition to these, there are many hidden issues, such as government debt and corruption. Together, these problems have caused more and more financial pressure on the local government. And how to improve the utilization of investment development and infrastructure, strengthening the labor efficiency of local cities, optimizing the management for the external population would be the most important aspects.
<br/>
## The First Core Questions to Answer:
Q1: Local governments have long relied on land sales to generate revenues. Is there a long-term solution that can replace this old way? How to relieve the local financial difficulties by institutional reform?
<br/>
China's local fiscal pressure is getting bigger and bigger. There are two main reasons for integrating China's current national conditions, and each reason can be divided into two aspects:

### 1. Income reduction
#### 1.1 Downside economic pressure

</div>
<br/>
<div align="left">
  In the past two years, industrial upgrading and transformation have been carried out throughout the country. The industrial restructuring has led to the gradual elimination of the old economic operation mode, such as strengthening the supervision and regulation of heavy polluting industries, requiring industrial and technological upgrading, the reduction and elimination of industries and factories that are incompatible with environmental sustainability. Representative areas such as Chongqing(the typical representative of heavy industry cities, the GDP growth rate in the early years was the top three or even the first in the country), from the 9.49% GDP growth rate in 2017 to the 4.83% GDP growth rate in 2018. The “2018 Report of China's Regional Financial Development Index” in the 7th issue of the “China Finance and Taxation Research Report”, by Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, Renmin University of China compiled the value and ranking of the local financial development index across the country. The index consists of five different indexes: fiscal revenue stability index, fiscal expenditure structure index, debt risk index, social security sustainability index and budget management index. The larger the value, the more stable and sufficient the fiscal revenue in the region. It can be seen from Figure 1 that Chongqing ranked last in 2016. The sharp drop in GDP growth in Chongqing was mainly attributable to the downward pressure on the industry across the country, especially in the automotive industry. In addition to Chongqing, many provinces across the country are facing a decline in tax revenue. Moreover, the government's determination to industrial transform has shifted its focus from mature industries to the new industries and service industry which usually need time to grow, so government tax revenues are also falling in the short term.

<div align="left">
  
#### 1.2 National tax reduction and reduction of personal social security contributions rate (since 2018) 
  In the second meeting of the 13th National People's Congress in 2019, Premier Li Keqiang said that in 2019, the corporate tax burden and social security contribution rate will be reduced. After the unprecedented tax cut and fee reduction, the overall social dividend would be about 2 trillion yuan. (The overall size of the national tax cut and fee reduction in 2018 is about 1.3 trillion). According to the latest national fiscal data in September 2019, the cumulative growth rate of national fiscal revenue in September 2019 was 3.3%, the same period in September 2018 was 8.7%, and the period in September 2017 was 9.7%. It can be seen that the government's tax cut and fee reduction policies have indeed caused pressure on local taxation and other sources of income across the country.

</div>
  
### 2. Increase in Expenditures
#### 2.1 Large investment

</div>

<br/>
  
<div align="left">
  Figure 2 shows the proportion of the five major categories of expenditures in 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipality in 2008 and 2016: administrative expenditures, people's livelihood expenditures, budgetary investment expenditures, general investment tendencies, and environmental expenditures. It can be seen that local governments have increased by a large portion in the two categories of intra-budgetary investment expenditure and generalized investment propensity, with an increase of 40.5% and 46.1% respectively, reflecting that local governments have continuously increased their investment since 2006.

</div>
  
<br/>
<div align="left">
Figure 3 shows the expenditures in the eastern, central and western regions. The total investment in the western region is significantly higher than that in the central and western regions, especially in the generalized investment propensity . This reflects that the western region government still focuses on infrastructure investment to stimulate the economy. Projects of Infrastructure are usually huge invested, and it is difficult to achieve returns and break-even in the short term. Therefore, the financial pressure that began to emerge.

<br/>

#### 2.2 The phenomenon of aging population is intensifying

</div>

<br/>
<div align="left">
As China's aging phenomenon accelerates, the local government's pension expenditures are increasing. First, as can be seen from Figure 4, since 2008, the surplus ratios of various funds have been declining. This reflects that the three major social security funds in China are facing surplus falling. As the population ages, the surplus of funds would probably decline continuously. Once the expenditure is greater than income, the government needs to increase subsidies and fill the gap. In addition, Figure 4 also shows that from 2008 to 2016, the dependency ratio of endowment insurance has also increased by 6.3%, which reflects that a large part of the pressure in China's social security fund comes from the aging population. This phenomenon has forced local governments to increase subsidies and cost the local budget.

<br/>
<div align="left">
Figures 5 and 6 show the dependency ratio of the elderly all over the country. The areas with severe population aging problems are mainly in the northeastern region. Representative provinces such as Liaoning and Heilongjiang, the dependency ratio of the elderly are higher than 15 times, the central government needs to support the pension expenditures every year. The fiscal burden of these provinces may become more severe as the aging problem becoming more serious in the future. In addition, areas with aging generally have problem with population outflows so that tax revenue and consumption contribution cannot be kept locally.

</div>

<br/>
<div align="left">
From figure 7, local governments rely on the revenue from land sales in various degrees. These one-time transactions are actually not conducive to the long-term development of a region and will squander limited resources in a short time. This is actually related to the political system. Governments at all levels need to achieve certain performances under the central government. The performance standard is often the GDP index. Local officials would use a large amount of local resources in order to pursue political achievements, achieve the best performance during their term of office, and then jump to higher level provinces or to the central. This mechanism allows local governments to have only short- and medium-term plans but not long-term development. The local development is actually influence by the personal factors of local officials.
To solve such problems, it is necessary for the central government's administrative reforms to include other measures besides GDP, such as the happiness index of residents and the utilization rate of local infrastructure. The most directly feasible method is to cut expenditures. Since the meeting held by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on December 4, 2012, and passed the "Eight Regulations," China's overall administrative expenditure has dropped significantly. Figure 2 shows the administrative expenditure fell by 6.78% in 2016 compared to 2006, but the data lack of transparency.

</div>
  
<br/>

<div align="left">
For example, it can be seen from Figure 8 that the national financial education expenditure disclosed by the National Bureau of Statistics in 2018 is ¥32,169.47 billion, an increase of about 3.5 times compared with ¥90,102.1 billion in 2008. However, the number of rural primary schools in China has decreased from 253,041 in 2008 to 161,811 in 2018, a decrease of about 35%. At the same time, the number of faculty across the country and rural faculty have also declined. The nationals do not know whether education expenditures have been used in the right way or not. In addition, the data of “Three public consumption” and “Other expenditures” in the budgetary expenditure have not been publicized for many years. Therefore, how to supervise and control local expenditures would be very important for solving financial pressures. If the local governments can cut unnecessary spending, and increase transparency in the use of funds so that the public can monitor the government's operation, the local finances will be greatly improved.
<br/>

### 3. Suggestion
Considering that local governments have rich experience in investment of infrastructure and large-scale projects, they can refer to the Hong Kong MTR approach in infrastructure and property investment. The operation mode of the MTR is based on the concentrated development of "Railway + Property Development". The entire project is centered on the subway station and targets the major industries in the region. The MTR corporation focuses on building a large number of properties connected to the subway, using the subway to promote regional economic development.

</div>

<br/>

<div align="left">
Take the stations opened by the MTR corporation in recent years as an example. As can be seen from Figure 9, the Hong Kong University Station, which were officially opened on December 28, 2014. The price of nearby property such as "Academic Terrace" increased from an average of HK$11,778 per square foot in November 2014 to average HK$15,622 per square foot in July 2015, raised about 32.6%.

</div>

<div align="left">

Figure 10 also shows that on October 23, 2016, after the opening of the line at Ho Man Tin Station, the price of the nearby property "Whampoa Garden", increased at a significantly faster rate. It rose from HK$13,744 in October 2016 to HK$14,988 in June 2017, an increase of about 10%.
The core of MTR corporation's high-profit with "railway + property development" is that the price of any area would usually increase after the opening of the subway. The synergistic effect of those properties with MTR stations would lead to regional business activity. Such as the recreation industry and service industry. In addition, the concentration of office buildings near the subway can also enhance efficiency. In order to improve the efficiency of the project, the government should invest in the railway company in the form of pure capital investment but does not participate in and interference with the operation of the railway company, so that the railway company is responsible for its own profits and losses. The railway company is no longer set up by the government's investing subsidiary and the government only shares dividends by the company.

## The Second Core Questions to Answer:
Q2: The problem of unequal resource allocation for urban and rural citizens in China is essentially derived from the household register system. Can the government cancel the household register system? What problems will arise if the household register system is canceled?

<br/>

China’s household-register system is essentially a tool for limiting resource allocation. Under the household-register system, people born in different regions can only register in the corresponding regions. This limits the movement of people in relatively backward areas to the more developed areas, so as to ensure that resources are retained and only distributed to the original residents of urban households. China's household-register system has a strong original accumulation function and done this job very good. However, with the progress of society and economy, policymakers have also begun to notice that the household-register system also limits the free flow and free pairing of resources. In the recent global economic downturn and transformation, whether or not to give greater mobility to the population becomes very important. In recent years, the government is indeed trying to liberalize and cancel the household-register system. As long as the various inequalities hidden behind the household-register system are resolved, the household-register system can be vigorously liberalized or even completely abolished, so as to exert the efficiency brought by the free flow of resources. The inequalities behind the household-register system can be roughly divided into three categories: 1. Inequality in human rights; 2. Inequality in property rights; 3. Inequality in public services.

<br/>

First of all, in terms of human rights, the migrant-worker without urban registration would face unequal treatment of housing rights. For example, if the migrant-workers live in the shantytown, once the government wants to levy the land, these migrant-workers would be arbitrary evicted. However, people with urban registration can obtain compensation.  If the government can solve the living problem for the migrant-workers in different regions while canceling the household-register system, this will lay an important foundation for the long-term population movement. 
Second, is the inequality in property rights. Farmers’ land is tied with their register-account and cannot be transferred except for their relatives. If the government directly cancels the household-register system but without corresponding supporting measures, it will lead to sharp conflicts in rural society. In fact, the local government does have incentives to recover the farmer's land, which is related to the officials' personal consideration. Although the State Council issued the "Opinions on Further Promoting the Reform of the Household Registration System " in 2014 and pointed out: "The abolition of rural register-account will not have any impact on farmers' contracted land, homesteads and other collective distribution rights." But in reality, not all the farmers have written land ownership. The land of farmers is usually farmland and for self-housing which left by their ancestors. Those properties usually have not confirmed by the government or not part of the homestead. Some farmers in remote areas cannot even have a way to know the national laws and regulations. For these people, their land would be confiscated easily by the government. It will cause a fierce social conflict, and adversely affect the country's stability.
Third, is the inequality of public services. Migrant-workers cannot enjoy the public services that urban residents generally have. The typical inequalities are education, medical service, and social security. The government must at least cover the basic satisfaction for the migrant-worker, and then they can further promote the reform of the household-register system. Otherwise, the social conflict will further intensify.

<br/>

## The Third Core Questions to Answer:
Q3:  Can China's current excess capacity (infrastructure, factories, etc.) be further transformed into development momentum? In particular, the excess capacity of second- and third-tier cities in China is caused by the outward migration of the population. Is there any way to digest these excess capacities or use other ways to drive local development?

</div>

<div align="center">
  <font color=black size=1>Figure 12 Japan Capacity Utilization</font>
</div>

<div align="left">
In the narrow sense of overcapacity, only the capacity utilization rate is considered, and China's total capacity utilization rate indeed has an excess. Figure 11 and Figure 12 show the capacity utilization rate of China and other countries. China's capacity utilization rate has remained at around 75% for a long time, while countries with more developed industries and technologies such as Japan can usually remain above 85%. China's current capacity utilization rate is about a medium and lower level at the world level. This is due to technological developments, social changes, and demand changes. In the decades of reform and opening-up, China's industry and manufacturing have changed a lot. Many capacities have played a huge role in construction, but it may no longer be applicable today: Part of the technology is outdated, resulting in unemployment and disposal of workers and factories; In addition, due to technological innovation, many older workers cannot easily learn new technologies, leading to inefficiency in new job or even unemployment. The overcapacity caused by technological innovation requires labor training to transform the older capacity. In terms of re-training, local governments can refer to the Employees Retraining Board, Labour and Welfare Bureau of Hong Kong Government. For example, the "Placement-tied Courses" link to relevant job opportunities. Trainees with good performance are provided with a 3-6 month placement follow-up services to help them re-enter the job market. In addition, there are also Generic Skills Training Courses, "Skills Upgrading Scheme Plus" Courses, Courses for Special Service Targets e.t.c., all information is publicized on the government website so the citizen can easily find it. China’s local governments can refer to these labor retraining programs, help workers re-join in industrial production and improve their work efficiency. This is a way to transform the older-capacity.

<br/>

Local governments can also develop their local specialties to drive local capacity utilization. For example, Heilongjiang is using the cultural advantages left by its own history to develop the northern cultural and creative industries. This kind of characteristic industry will become a trend in the future and can support the regional economy. And to better follow this trend, how to attract people would be the first consideration as we know people are a very important element to develop a city. For example, more regulatory and evaluation measures to improve the government's operation efficiency, simplify the registration procedures for immigrants, strengthen the portability and coherence of medical insurance. These all are very helpful to attract migrants.

### Conslusion
The local governments should consider their characteristic industry with their own cities when developing infrastructure, and try to cooperate with those industries to bring the appreciation of assets value and development. 
Theses development plans can be lead by the government and contracted to private enterprises by public bidding, especially the operation of some surrounding supporting facilities, such as green development and general facilities (elevator, etc.). And the most important thing is the development of urban railways and the way the government participates in. It is necessary to properly choose the participation mode according to local conditions. However, the government should still in the form of pure shareholding and do not interfere with the decision-making of the railway company.

<br/>

Local government can also improve population management, simplify the application process for migrants with different register-account, and improve the welfare policies for migrants (including education, medical service, housing) to attract more young labor. When more youth come to the city, it would be able to bring more vitality and give stronger competitiveness.
As long as the government can properly select priority objectives, solve them orderly, and not be too hasty. These problems could be solved in the future.

# What Are The Fundamental Causes Of The Local Financial Difficulties in China? 

## Summary  
It can be said that the local financial difficulties in China are caused by many reasons. The overcapacity problems left by the rapid industrial development in the early years, the lack of long-term development projects of the government (long-term taxation raise from the development of enterprises and citizens), low utilization of infrastructure and urban facilities (Empty Cities), restrictions on the free flow of population, and the unwilling of enterprises to entry caused by the opacity of the system. In addition to these, there are many hidden issues, such as government debt and corruption. Together, these problems have caused more and more financial pressure on the local government. And how to improve the utilization of investment development and infrastructure, strengthening the labor efficiency of local cities, optimizing the management for the external population would be the most important aspects.
<br/>
## Three Core Questions to answer:
Q1: Local governments have long relied on land sales to generate revenues. Is there a long-term solution that can replace this old way? How to relieve the local financial difficulties by institutional reform?
<br/>
China's local fiscal pressure is getting bigger and bigger. There are two main reasons for integrating China's current national conditions, and each reason can be divided into two aspects:

### 1. Income reduction
#### 1.1 Downside economic pressure

<div align="left">
  In the past two years, industrial upgrading and transformation have been carried out throughout the country. The industrial restructuring has led to the gradual elimination of the old economic operation mode, such as strengthening the supervision and regulation of heavy polluting industries, requiring industrial and technological upgrading, the reduction and elimination of industries and factories that are incompatible with environmental sustainability. Representative areas such as Chongqing(the typical representative of heavy industry cities, the GDP growth rate in the early years was the top three or even the first in the country), from the 9.49% GDP growth rate in 2017 to the 4.83% GDP growth rate in 2018. The “2018 Report of China's Regional Financial Development Index” in the 7th issue of the “China Finance and Taxation Research Report”, by Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, Renmin University of China compiled the value and ranking of the local financial development index across the country. The index consists of five different indexes: fiscal revenue stability index, fiscal expenditure structure index, debt risk index, social security sustainability index and budget management index. The larger the value, the more stable and sufficient the fiscal revenue in the region. It can be seen from Figure 1 that Chongqing ranked last in 2016. The sharp drop in GDP growth in Chongqing was mainly attributable to the downward pressure on the industry across the country, especially in the automotive industry. In addition to Chongqing, many provinces across the country are facing a decline in tax revenue. Moreover, the government's determination to industrial transform has shifted its focus from mature industries to the new industries and service industry which usually need time to grow, so government tax revenues are also falling in the short term.

#### 1.2 National tax reduction and reduction of personal social security contributions rate (since 2018) 
  In the second meeting of the 13th National People's Congress in 2019, Premier Li Keqiang said that in 2019, the corporate tax burden and social security contribution rate will be reduced. After the unprecedented tax cut and fee reduction, the overall social dividend would be about 2 trillion yuan. (The overall size of the national tax cut and fee reduction in 2018 is about 1.3 trillion). According to the latest national fiscal data in September 2019, the cumulative growth rate of national fiscal revenue in September 2019 was 3.3%, the same period in September 2018 was 8.7%, and the period in September 2017 was 9.7%. It can be seen that the government's tax cut and fee reduction policies have indeed caused pressure on local taxation and other sources of income across the country.

### 2. Increase in Expenditures
#### 2.1 Large investment

  Figure 2 shows the proportion of the five major categories of expenditures in 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipality in 2008 and 2016: administrative expenditures, people's livelihood expenditures, budgetary investment expenditures, general investment tendencies, and environmental expenditures. It can be seen that local governments have increased by a large portion in the two categories of intra-budgetary investment expenditure and generalized investment propensity, with an increase of 40.5% and 46.1% respectively, reflecting that local governments have continuously increased their investment since 2006.

<br/>
  
Figure 3 shows the expenditures in the eastern, central and western regions. The total investment in the western region is significantly higher than that in the central and western regions, especially in the generalized investment propensity . This reflects that the western region government still focuses on infrastructure investment to stimulate the economy. Projects of Infrastructure are usually huge invested, and it is difficult to achieve returns and break-even in the short term. Therefore, the financial pressure that began to emerge.

#### 2.2 The phenomenon of aging population is intensifying

  </div>

<br/>

As China's aging phenomenon accelerates, the local government's pension expenditures are increasing. First, as can be seen from Figure 4, since 2008, the surplus ratios of various funds have been declining. This reflects that the three major social security funds in China are facing surplus falling. As the population ages, the surplus of funds would probably decline continuously. Once the expenditure is greater than income, the government needs to increase subsidies and fill the gap. In addition, Figure 4 also shows that from 2008 to 2016, the dependency ratio of endowment insurance has also increased by 6.3%, which reflects that a large part of the pressure in China's social security fund comes from the aging population. This phenomenon has forced local governments to increase subsidies and cost the local budget.

<br/>
Figures 5 and 6 show the dependency ratio of the elderly all over the country. The areas with severe population aging problems are mainly in the northeastern region. Representative provinces such as Liaoning and Heilongjiang, the dependency ratio of the elderly are higher than 15 times, the central government needs to support the pension expenditures every year. The fiscal burden of these provinces may become more severe as the aging problem becoming more serious in the future. In addition, areas with aging generally have problem with population outflows so that tax revenue and consumption contribution cannot be kept locally.
